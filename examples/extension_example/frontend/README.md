# Frontend

This is the frontend (the viewers experience) side of the Twitch extension example project.

## Getting Started

The following line must be added to the `<body>` of the HTML file.

```html
<script src="https://extension-files.twitch.tv/helper/v1/twitch-ext.min.js"></script>
```
This script is necessary for the Twitch extension to function correctly, as it provides the required helper functions, APIs and authentication mechanisms.
